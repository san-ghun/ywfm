# ywfm - "You're welcome, future me!"

Do something today that your future self will thank you for. 

## Goal
- Python3 script file to execute and work as reminder, target OS for macOS and Linux.
- The program will use `terminal-notifier` for macOS and `notify-send` for Linux.
- The program will take options,
    - `--title <string>`
    - `--subtitle <string>`
    - `--open <URL>`
    - `--command <string>`
    - `--timer <string>`

- An example command would be like this:
    ```bash
    > reminder --title "Start building" --subtitle "github auth feat" --open "https://github.com/" --command 'echo hello' --timer 1h10m15s
    ```

Say thank you to past self. 

> Thank you, past me.
> 
> *Good job, future me.*
> 
> Well done, past me.
>
> And, thanks a lot.
